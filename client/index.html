      hello and welcome<br>
      0: table of contents<br><br>

      since last episode<br>
      1: greenlights -> summary project and what that presentation was<br>
      2: a. + exhibition demo -> before was experimental presentation, what it is now<br>
      3: socket experiment -> references of interaction, how to engage audience & take advantage of online-ness so that project can travel (phone)<br>
      4: coordText experiments -> develop tools to be understandable to user<br>
      5: ascii experiments -> figuring out how to design with these things i made up<br>
      6: ascii experiments -> refining how they're encountered visually, combined<br>
      7: b. + c. -> came hand in hand, developed through writing<br>
      8: before wasn't sure what i wanted from project, made in reaction to situation. after reflecting, made a script that introduces the project and myself to audience outside kabk, discussing my perspective on the issue and inviting collab<br><br>

      reviewing the whole season<br>
      9: we can get back to this, now zoom out and talk about the development of my design practice within this project and studies. This project challenged me into learning several lessons:<br>
      10: glass half full -> embracing mentality within project as a way to deal with my own ambition. being strategic with what's possible within timeframe of grad. accepting there's more development to be made.<br>
      11: design intentions -> accepting this about myself over course of project, helps to not compare myself to classmates or perceived kabk ideal<br>
      12: confidence -> speaking of, earlier in the year i struggled with visual essay because it wasn't my "language". Bart told me to be braver in bending the rules so they make sense for me. Lead up to greenlights being unsure of trying out different format, continuing effort to think in this way.<br>
      13: back-end -> more practical, project REALLY challenged my technical skills, both in terms of experimenting with something i knew and learning something completely new like python or back-end. Very scary!. Learning to ask for help and where to look for it.<br><br>

      14: The end
